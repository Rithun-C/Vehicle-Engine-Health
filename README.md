# **Vehicle Engine Health Prediction**

This project leverages machine learning (Gradient Boosting) and interpretability tools (SHAP values) to predict and analyze the health of vehicle engines. The goal is to ensure proactive maintenance, reduce downtime, and optimize vehicle performance.

---

## **Features**
- Predict engine health states (e.g., **Healthy**, **Needs Maintenance**, or **Critical**).
- Analyze feature contributions to predictions using SHAP for explainability.
- Identify potential issues through data insights and anomaly detection.
- Optimize maintenance schedules and improve reliability.

---

## **Technologies Used**
- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Machine Learning Frameworks:** 
  - GradientBoost
- **Interpretability Tool:** SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations)
- **Visualization Tools:** Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly
- **Data Processing Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn

## **Project Workflow**
1. **Data Collection:**
   - Sensor data: RPM, oil pressure, temperature, vibration levels.
   - Metadata: Vehicle type, age, maintenance history.
2. **Data Preprocessing:**
   - Handle missing values, outliers, and normalize features.
   - Perform feature engineering and encoding of categorical data.
3. **Model Training:**
   - Train a Gradient Boosting model on labeled datasets.
   - Tune hyperparameters for optimal performance.
4. **Interpretability with SHAP:**
   - Evaluate global feature importance.
   - Analyze individual predictions for better transparency.
5. **Visualization:**
   - Use SHAP plots (Summary, Force, Dependence) to explain model outputs.

   ```bash
   python train_model.py
   ```
3. Analyze predictions with SHAP:
   ```bash
   python shap_analysis.py
   ```
4. Visualize results using the provided Jupyter notebooks or scripts.

---

## **Results**
- **Model Performance:** Accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score on test data.
- **SHAP Insights:**
  - Top features influencing predictions.
  - Explainability of individual predictions.

---

## **Future Enhancements**
